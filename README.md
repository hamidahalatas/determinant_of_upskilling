# Levelling Up: Determinant of Upskilling Among Indonesian Workforce
Thesis Proposal

### Abstract

Upskilling, defined as an effort to help someone learning new professional skills to participate in the economy, is the key to helping people integrate into better and improved jobs. It has been proven that upskilling has many benefits, including boosting economic growth improving the overall quality of jobs. However, willingness to upskill could vary between demographic features such as age and education. There is a big question regarding whether these variables also determine whether someone will participate in the government-provided skill training in Indonesia, the Pre-Employment Card program. Identifying characteristics of people who participate in this program could help the government emphasize their focus on advocating and making the program more compelling to the most vulnerable group.

There is one outcome of interest in this research, participation in the Pre-Employment Card program, with age and education level as the independent variables of interest. Besides the mentioned variables, other features and demographic features such as gender, previous working status, activity in the last week, and previous training participation will also be regressed to the outcome. 

The hypothesis is that age and education level, after controlling for other demographic characteristics, are the most important determinants of the Pre-Employment Card program. Using logistic regression and dominance analysis, this study will explore the association (not necessarily causation) between our independent variables of interest and participation in skill training and how strong the relationship is compared to other variables.
